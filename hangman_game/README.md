Welcome to Hangman! This classic word-guessing game will test your vocabulary and keep you on the edge of your seat.

How to Play:

The game will choose a secret word from a list. Don't worry, you won't know what it is!
You'll see a row of underscores, representing the number of letters in the secret word.
Take your guess by entering a single letter.
If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in its corresponding positions in the word.
If your guess is incorrect, you lose a life.
The game keeps track of your remaining lives with a visual representation of a hangman being built (more wrong guesses = closer to being "hanged").
Keep guessing letters until you either:
Win: Guess all the letters correctly before running out of lives.
Lose: Run out of lives by making too many wrong guesses.
Tips:

Choose your letters wisely! Consider the frequency of letters in the English language and the revealed letters in the word.
Don't be afraid to take risks, but avoid repeating guesses.
Use your logic and deduction skills to narrow down the possibilities.
Have fun and good luck!

Note: This program utilizes modules hangman_words.py and hangman_art.py for word selection and visual representation. These modules are not included in this file but are essential for the game's functionality.
